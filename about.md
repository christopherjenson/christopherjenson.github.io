Father, Husband and Veteran.

I'm a Senior Systems Engineer by day specializing in End User Compute.  Virtual Desktop Infrastructure mostly, but have performed various roles in the past comprising of Device Management, Mobile Device Management, Application deployment, Group Policy Administration and anything else that delivers the best quality and experience.  I also specialize in the consumption and enjoyment of coffee which is proportionately increased by the previous.

I'm fortunate to be part of a team that is revolutionizing the idea of how Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is managed and delivered, utilizing Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Configuration Management using Ansible. 

### Current Information Technology Industry Certifications
