title: Starting off 2022 the right way
---
Like a lot of people say, I'm not the type to have New Years resolutions. 

I am closing out the year by taking time off and spending as much of that time with my family. I am also using a portion of that time trying to bring into focus what direction I want to take in 2022. How will I hold myself accountable? What learning paths do I want to pursue? What challenges should I take on?

I've been entertaining the idea of blogging for a while and contributing to the community, but I've not taken that first step. I've been in the very fortunate position to be able to rapidly grow both in my career but also as an individual and professional.  I believe that we should all do what we can to contribute to the encouragement and success of others.  Hopefully I can find that medium here.
